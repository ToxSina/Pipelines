List of input file identifiers (basenames): infiles.txt


This might have to be run in batches (so create batch files from infiles.txt
by using
split -d -l <#samples per batch> batch infiles.txt

Example Host database for slurm_filterHost:
Human HG38: /rds/project/rds-XUr6B1Jhndg/sb2534_Sina/databases/GRCh38/GRCh38_Bowtie2

Run in this order:
rawqc.sh & trimming.sh
gzip.sh (At this point raw data can be removed if it is already archived on Citrix)
trimqc.sh & filter.sh
filterqc.sh & assembly.sh
If assemblies don't finish in the 36 hrs: reSpades.sh (for these infiles, save them in redo.txt)
scaffold.sh
weight.sh
align.sh
lrrma.sh
