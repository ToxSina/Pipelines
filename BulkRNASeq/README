logs

List of input file identifiers (basenames): infiles.txt

Adapt rename.sh as needed to simplify file names

Run in this order:
rename.sh (if neccessary, put into 00_DATA, adapt and run)
rawqc.sh & trimming.sh
gzip.sh (At this point raw data can be removed if it is already archived on Citrix)
trimqc.sh & alignment.sh
featureCounts.sh (At this point 04_ALIGNED can be removed, as sorted files are smaller and better further on.)
