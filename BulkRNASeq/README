Directories needed to create:
00_DATA
01_RAWQC
02_TRIMMED
03_TRIMQC
04_ALIGNED
05_SORTED
logs

List of input file identifiers (basenames): infiles.txt

Adapt rename.sh as needed to simplify file names (needs to be moved into 00_DATA to run for now)

Adapt slurm_alignment to use the appropriate HISAT2 reference.
Human HG38: /rds/project/rds-XUr6B1Jhndg/sb2534_Sina/databases/GRCh38/GRCh38_Hisat2
Mouse mm39: /rds/project/rds-XUr6B1Jhndg/sb2534_Sina/databases/mouse/current/genome/mm39_Hisat2

Adapt slurm_featurecount to use the appropriate gtf file.
Human HG38: /rds/project/rds-XUr6B1Jhndg/sb2534_Sina/databases/GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.104.gtf
Mouse mm39: /rds/project/rds-XUr6B1Jhndg/sb2534_Sina/databases/mouse/current/genome/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.106.gtf

Run in this order:
rename.sh (if neccessary, put into 00_DATA, adapt and run)
rawqc.sh & trimming.sh
gzip.sh (At this point raw data can be removed if it is already archived on Citrix)
trimqc.sh & alignment.sh
featureCounts.sh (At this point 04_ALIGNED can be removed, as sorted files are smaller and better further on.)
