Directories needed to create:
00_DATA
01_RAWQC
02_TRIMMED
03_TRIMQC
04_ALIGNED
05_SORTED
06_PON
07_MUTECT
08_FILTERED
logs

List of input file identifiers (basenames): infiles.txt
List of non-normal identifiers (not controls): nonnormal.txt
List of normals for creating a Panel Of Normals if needed:
pons.list (must include file path at least relative, so 06_PON/...)

Replace appropriate Bowtie2 reference in slurm_alignment
Mouse mm28 (not current): /rds/project/rds-XUr6B1Jhndg/sb2534_Sina/databases/mm28/mm10_bowtie2
Human hs38: /rds/project/rds-XUr6B1Jhndg/sb2534_Sina/databases/GRCh38/GRch38_Bowtie2

Replace appropriate FASTA reference in slurm_mutect and slurm_mutectFilter
Mouse mm28 (not current): /rds/project/rds-XUr6B1Jhndg/sb2534_Sina/databases/mm28/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna.toplevel.fa
Human hs38: /rds/project/rds-XUr6B1Jhndg/sb2534_Sina/databases/GRCh38/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa

Run in this order:
rawqc.sh & trimming.sh
gzip.sh (At this point raw data can be removed if it is already archived on Citrix)
trimqc.sh & alignment.sh
index.sh
If creating PON: mutect_pons.sh, then sbatch slurm_multivcf, then sbatch slurm_pon
mutect_nonnormal.sh
filter.sh
